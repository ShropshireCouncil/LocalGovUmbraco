# LocalGov Umbraco

LocalGov Umbraco is a website "starter kit" built on top of [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/) CMS, in the spirit of the [LocalGovDrupal](https://localgovdrupal.org/) project.

In line with the [Local Digital Declaration](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/), we belive that open collaboration allows councils to deliver a better digital experience for their citizens while saving time and money by avoiding duplicating the effort of prior development.
